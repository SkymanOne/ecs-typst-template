    *You must change the statements in the boxes if you do not agree with them.*


    We expect you to acknowledge all sources of information (e.g. ideas, algorithms, data) using citations. You must also put quotation marks around any sections of text that you have copied without paraphrasing. If any figures or tables have been taken or modified from another source, you must explain this in the caption and cite the original source.

    #box(info: acknowledged)

    If you have used any code (e.g. open-source code), reference designs, or similar resources 
    that have been produced by anyone else, you must list them in the box below. In the
    report, you must explain what was used and how it relates to the work you have done.

    #box(info: resources)

    You can consult with module teaching staff/demonstrators, but you should not show
    anyone else your work (this includes uploading your work to publicly-accessible repositories 
    e.g. Github, unless expressly permitted by the module leader), or help them to
    do theirs. For individual assignments, we expect you to work on your own. For group
    assignments, we expect that you work only with your allocated group. You must get
    permission in writing from the module teaching staff before you seek outside assistance,
    e.g. a proofreading service, and declare it here.

    #box(info: foreign)

    We expect that you have not fabricated, modified or distorted any data, evidence, 
    references, experimental results, or other material used or presented in the report. 
    You must clearly describe your experiments and how the results were obtained, and include
    all data, source code and/or designs (either in the report, or submitted as a separate
    file) so that your results could be reproduced.

    #box(info: material)

    We expect that you have not previously submitted any part of this work for another
    assessment. You must get permission in writing from the module teaching staff before
    re-using any of your previously submitted work for this assessment.

    #box(info: reuse)

    If your work involved research/studies (including surveys) on human participants, their
    cells or data, or on animals, you must have been granted ethical approval before the
    work was carried out, and any experiments must have followed these requirements. You
    must give details of this in the report, and list the ethical approval reference number(s)
    in the box below.
